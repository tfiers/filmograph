*A superior version of IMDb's "Known For" feature.*

When you're watching a movie or a TV show, you may get the intriguing feeling that you recognize the people on screen. To satisfy your curiosity, I am creating this app. It lets the user search for movies, TV shows and people, and shows them a comprehensive graphical overview of the roles that people played in different productions.

Current state of the project: proof of concept. (Find the **[v0.1 release](https://github.com/tfiers/screenkin/releases/tag/v0.1)** here.)

See the **[Wiki](https://github.com/tfiers/screenkin/wiki)** for setup instructions.
